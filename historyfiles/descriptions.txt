RIZAL PARK

It was officially named Rizal Park, after the name of Dr. Jose Rizal, our national hero, as an honor and tribute to him. It is also called Luneta Park because the area looks like a crescent (Lunette). It is situated next to Intramuros, which was then a Spanish fort that served as a buffer during rebellions. Before, the name of the place was Bagumbayan (“new town” in English). 

Luneta has been the site of the most significant moments in the Philippine History. The execution of pacifist Dr. Jose Rizal on December 30, 1896 sparked the fire of the Philippine Revolution against the Spanish colonizers, thus making him a hero of the Philippine Revolution and the national hero of the country. The Declaration of the Philippine Independence from American Rule was held on July 4, 1946 at 9:15 am at the front of Rizal’s monument as authorized by the United States President Harry S. Truman. The Independence Flagpole is the highest flagpole in the Philippines with the height of 107 metres. Political rallies in 1986 also happened here, leading to the EDSA Revolution which ended the Marcos Dictatorship.

PLAZA CUARTEL

Built sometime in the 1940s, Plaza Cuartel once served as a stronghold of American and Filipino soldiers until they were overrun by Japanese invaders. The stronghold, once a haven of our brave warriors, became a prison. 143 American prisoners were routed and stuffed in this tunnel with virtually no food or water. Then on December 14, 1944, soldiers of the Japanese Imperial Army poured fuel on the prisoners and set them on fire. 11 prisoners narrowly escaped the massacre.

Despite the gloomy history of the place, Plaza Cuartel has become a popular haven for the locals. The plaza is designed as a classic, verdant Pinoy-style park that can be seen in many towns and cities nationwide.

CORREGIDOR

Corregidor is a Spanish term which means corregir — “to correct”. The Spanish lighthouse and the marker nearby, as well as the flagpole at Topside taken from a Spanish warship, are witnesses to the fact that before Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States in 1898, after the Spanish-American War, Corregidor Island used to be a checkpoint for vessels entering Manila Bay. A marker reads in part: “Corregidor Island became a part of the Spanish Crown on May the 19th 1571 after its occupation by the dauntless Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, who found the City of Manila. Due to its strategic position, Corregidor, which was a Spanish island for 327 years until May 2, 1898, served as a fortress, guarding Manila Bay.” Corregidor is the largest of the five islands guarding the entrance to Manila Bay. A tadpole-shaped isle, Corregidor was once a mere fishing village with a lighthouse and signal station for all ships entering and leaving Manila Bay. American colonizers built full-scale fortifications on the island, complete with long-range tractor guns, anti-aircraft guns, tunnels, an underground command center, and a hospital for wounded soldiers. In the last Pacific War, Corregidor became a vital combat zone between the Japanese Imperial Army and the allied forces. It was the last stronghold to fall in the hands of the enemy.

LIMASAWA


The first Catholic mass in the Philippines happened on March 31, 1521, just three days after Ferdinand Magellan landed on Philippine shore. This event is seen to be the birth of Roman Catholicism in the country.

FORT SAN PEDRO

The fort was originally made of wood and built after the arrival of Spanish explorer Miguel López de Legazpi. (He came 4 years after Magellan). Lopez commanded the construction of the fort since he established himself the first governor of the Captaincy General of the Philippines.
Is the oldest triangular shaped fort in the country. It served as the nucleus of the first Spanish settlement in the Philippines. During the Philippine Revolution (late 1890’s), the fort was attacked and taken by Filipino revolutionaries, who used it as a stronghold.
Then in the early 1940’s, during World War II, the fort served as the fortification of the Japanese soldiers.
It also became part of the American Warwick Barracks during the American Regime (1898). During this period, Filipino revolutionaries fought with the Americans against the invading Japanese troops on the island.

LEYTE LANDING MEMORIAL PARK

The Leyte Landing Memorial in Red Beach, Palo, marks the spot where American liberation forces of General Douglas MacArthur landed. The Battle of Leyte in the Pacific campaign of World War II was the invasion and conquest of Leyte in the Philippines by the United States and Australian forces and allied Filipino guerrillas under the command of General Douglas MacArthur and waged against the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines led by General Tomoyuki Yamashita from 17 October 1944 to 31 July 1945. The battle launched the Philippines campaign of 1944-45 for the recapture and liberation of the entire Philippine Archipelago and to end almost three years of Japanese occupation.
