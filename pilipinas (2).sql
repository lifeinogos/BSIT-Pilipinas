They are frequenty called the "Eighth Wonder of the World". It is commonly thought that the terraces were built with minimal equipment, largely by hand. The terraces are located approximately 1500 metres (5000 ft) above sea level. They are fed by an ancient irrigation system from the rainforests above the terraces. It is said that if the steps were put end to end, it would encircle half the globe.\r\nLocals to this day still plant rice and vegetables on the terraces, although more and more younger Ifugaos do not find farming appealing, often opting for the more lucrative hospitality industry generated by the terraces[citation needed]. The result is the gradual erosion of the characteristic "steps", which need constant reconstruction and care. In 2010, a further problem was drought, with the terraces drying up completely in March of that year.', 3, 'Banaue', 'Ifugao', 'CAR', 5, 5, 1, 'img/places/car/place/car_1_3.jpg'),

They are covered in green grass that turns brown (like chocolate) during the dry season, hence the name.\r\nThe Chocolate Hills is a famous tourist attraction of Bohol. They are featured in the provincial flag and seal to symbolize the abundance of natural attractions in the province. They are in the Philippine Tourism Authority\'s list of tourist destinations in the Philippines; they have been declared the country\'s third National Geological Monument and proposed for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List', 3, 'Carmen', 'Bohol', '7', 2, 4, 2, 'img/places/region_7/place/7_1_4.jpg'),

The river is also called Puerto Princesa Underground River. The national park is located in the Saint Paul Mountain Range on the western coast of the island. It is bordered by St. Paul Bay to the north and the Babuyan River to the east. The City Government of Puerto Princesa has managed the National Park since 1992. The entrance to the subterranean river is a short hike or boat ride from the town Sabang.\r\nIn 2010, a group of environmentalists and geologists discovered that the underground river has a second floor, which means that there are small waterfalls inside the cave. They also found a cave dome measuring 300 m (980 ft) above the underground river, rock formations, large bats, a deep water hole in the river, more river channels, and another deep cave, as well as marine creatures and more. Deeper areas of the underground river are almost impossible to explore due to oxygen deprivation.[clarification needed]\r\nOn November 11, 2011, Puerto Princesa Underground River was provisionally chosen as one of the New7Wonders of Nature. This selection was officially confirmed on January 28, 2012.', 3, 'Puerto Princesa', 'Palawan', '4b', 5, 10, 2, 'img/places/region_4b/place/4b_1_5.jpg'),

Rizal Park is one of the major tourist attractions of Manila.\r\nSituated by the Manila Bay, it is an important site in Philippine history. The execution of national hero Jos√© Rizal on December 30, 1896 fanned the flames of the 1896 Philippine Revolution against the Kingdom of Spain. The area was officially renamed Rizal Park in his honor, and the monument enshrining his remains serves as the park\'s symbolic focal point.
